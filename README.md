This is my first GitHub repository and honestly I am not quite sure what I am doing yet.  I have been learning HTML and CSS as the initial step in studying full-stack web development.  I plan to use this account to showcase projects I make as I continue learning.
I am 26 years old and I live in Virginia on the East coast of the United States.
