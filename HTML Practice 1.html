  <h1> Welcome to Skilled Sychophantic Services Incorporated </h1>
  
  <p> Here at Skilled Sychophantic Services Incorporated, or SSS as we like to call ourselves--it's prounced "ssss" like the sound a snake makes by the way, one does not just read 
  the three letters when saying our name, just FYI y'all--anyway, here at SSS, we strive to make you feel as awesome as you probably are not.  We want you to feel like we think you 
  are by far the coolest individual, the most unique person, the most incredibly talented lady or gentlemen or otherwise that we have ever, EVER encountered.  We want to thoroughly 
  kiss your ass for a totally reasonable fee! So let's get down to it, shall we? </p>

  <p> So, you may be thinking, "Psh, why would I want you to kiss my ass? That's totally gross. And you expect me to pay you for it?"  Well, firstly, we're not literally going to kiss 
  your fucking ass, you pervert--I mean, unless the price is right, ya know what I'm sayin'?. It's what you call <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/browse/metaphor" target="_blank"> 
  a fucking metaphor </a> . And yeah, we do expect you to pay for it, because the constant flattery that you require is totally exhausting and counts as arduous work.  It only stands to reason,
  therefore, that you should pay for it. Agreed? Okay. </p> 
  
  <p> For all of you who didn't fall into that category, and I'm sure that's pretty much all of my readers, I am so, so sorry to have inconvenienced you with having to deal with 
  those horrible, horrible trolls.  You are of course a fantastic and well-informed person, cleverer than most of your peers, and you already know the value of indulging in some
  well-earned ass-kissing.  So, truly, as competent and wise as you are, I am sure there's no real need to list reasons why paying for a service such as ours might benefit you,
  but we think it obligatory, so we humbly ask you to indulge us:
